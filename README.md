Handwritten Digit Recognition ‚úçÔ∏è
This project demonstrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built to classify handwritten digits (0-9). The model is trained on the widely-used MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark in the field of deep learning.


Project Structure üìÅ
main.py: This script handles the entire training pipeline. It loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset, builds the CNN model, trains it, and saves the final model for later use.

predict.py: This script is used for inference. It loads the pre-trained model and makes predictions on new, unseen handwritten digit images.

digit_recognizer_model.keras: This is the trained model file, generated by main.py after a successful training run.


Key Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
Python: The core programming language.

TensorFlow & Keras: The deep learning framework used to build and train the model.

NumPy: Used for efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.

Matplotlib: Used to visualize the results, showing the predicted and actual digits.


How to Run the Project üöÄ
1. Training the Model
To train the model from scratch, simply run the main.py script from your terminal.

python main.py
This will output the training progress and save the trained model as digit_recognizer_model.keras.


2. Making Predictions
To use the trained model for inference on new images, run the predict.py script.


python predict.py
This will load the saved model, make a prediction on a sample image from the test set, and display the result in a new window.
