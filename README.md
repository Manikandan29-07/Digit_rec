# Handwritten Digit Recognition ✍️

This project demonstrates a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built to classify handwritten digits (0-9). The model is trained on the widely-used **MNIST dataset**, a classic benchmark in the field of deep learning.

***

## Project Structure 📁

- **`main.py`**: This script handles the entire training pipeline. It loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset, builds the CNN model, trains it, and saves the final model for later use.
- **`predict.py`**: This script is used for inference. It loads the pre-trained model and makes predictions on new, unseen handwritten digit images.
- **`digit_recognizer_model.keras`**: This is the trained model file, generated by `main.py` after a successful training run.

***

## Key Technologies 🛠️

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: The deep learning framework used to build and train the model.
- **NumPy**: Used for efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Used to visualize the results, showing the predicted and actual digits.

## How to Run the Project 🚀

### 1. Training the Model

To train the model from scratch, simply run the `main.py` script from your terminal.

```bash
python main.py
